# Demonstrators

The purpose of this section is to keep a collection of small-size sample programs to support the review and testing carried out during the evaluation phase of the OSPARC project.

At this level:
  - every folder contains a code sample that demonstrates a technology and/or a programming concept.
  - contain some documentation (README.md and Review.md) that describes, explains and discusses the demo.
  - every demo must be self-contained (i.e. within a docker) so it can be easily deployed
  - can start a demo (or a part of it) with ```cd my-demo/ && make demo```

Other facts:
- Built images of some of these demos can be pulled from [itisfoundation@dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/itisfoundation/sandbox/)
