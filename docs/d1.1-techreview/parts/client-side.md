### Client-side

The front-end part corresponds to the software running on the client side. The server-side transmits the program/instructions to the web-browser, on the client-side, which interprets and executes them. The front-end interacts directly with the user and for that reason, one of its main features of front-end frameworks is the Graphical User Interface (GUI). There is a wide variety of frameworks that supports the development of front-ends among which we have pre-selected:
  - vue.js: TODO short desc
  - react.js: TODO short desc
  - qooxdoo: TODO short desc
  - Wt: TODO short desc
