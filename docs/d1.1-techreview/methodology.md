## Methodology

This evaluation started with a pre-selection of technologies (i.e. libraries, framework, toolkits, models, ...) for different components of the oSPARC platform, namely the front-end (client-side), the web back-end (server-side), the communication models and the computational services.

The criteria used during this pre-selection accounted for mainly three factors:

- *Completeness*: the selected framework must include functions or accept extensions that support key features for its purpose. For instance, a suitable web-framework must include features for routing, database models, web-security, etc, which cover the essential functionality expected for the server-side.
- *Sustainability*: the selected technology should be long-term maintainable as an open-source project. Two key measures of sustainability considered here are its popularity, the support of the developers community (i.e documentation, fixes, releases, ...) and the license terms.  
- *Productivity*: we believe that productivity can be achieved with the combination of a suitable framework (e.g. complete, easy-to-use, and sustainable), the effectiveness reusing existing functionality and the previous experience of the team on a specific technology. For that reason, the pre-selection should incorporate options that combine both novel as well as already established programming paradigms (e.g. languages, design-patterns or even specific frameworks).


TODO: part 2
Once some technologies are pre-selected, the review adopts a more practical approach. Every technology chosen in the first part is then used to implement a simplified user story.

implements demos
resembles a practical case necessary for the framework.
For instance, the front-end  .


TODO: part 3. recommendations: which remain and why (e.g. under given circumstances) and which are discarded
For third party
