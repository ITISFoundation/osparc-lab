Requirements and specifications have been established based on interviews with SPARC teams as well as the results of the technology evaluation. The requirements are very much aligned with prior expectations and only minor adaptation of the proposal and possibly a change in prioritization is suggested. The technology evaluation has resulted in a clear idea of the technologies and approach that should be applied to implement the SPARC SIM-CORE platform. The design of the platform will enable maximal flexibility with regard to the wide variety of existing and envisioned user-generated modeling services. It will also offer user-friendly interfaces, allowing users to engage on different levels with the platform, ranging from simple execution of existing models to the advanced generation of services with fine-grained control over dedicated user-interface elements, depending on expertise. Due to the modularity of the chosen approach, it will be simple to extend and adapt the platform at later time-points, and it will be feasible to revisit some of the choices as technology evolves and to replace layers or components of the implementation without necessitating a complete redesign of the platform.
