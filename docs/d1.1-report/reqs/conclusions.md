The willingness to participate in the requirement gathering interviews was high. There is important enthusiasm about both, the possibility of sharing own models in a friendly way without having to invest a lot in developing user-interface functionality, and the potential of getting access to powerful solvers, meta-modeling functionality, electrophysiology models, and analysis tools. Quality assurance aspects, data&model integration, user-friendliness, computational infrastructure, anatomical models, and support for workflows are other highly valued components. The platform concept, as developed throughout the SIM-CORE application process appears to be very well suited to the requirements, with few extensions being required (support for “supercomputing”, workflows (s. side-car concept below), nerve microstructure modeling, machine learning, additional animal anatomical models as well as a detailed spinal cord model, modeling of fields generated by neural activity for sensing, and further meta-modeling (control, model order reduction) xxx). Certain aspects do not seem to currently be of high priority (scripting interface, image-processing beyond segmentation xxx). Providing users with proper support will be fundamental in assuring widespread platform adoption.
