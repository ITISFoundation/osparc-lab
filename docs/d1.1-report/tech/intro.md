The results on the **technology evaluation** are reported in three main blocks starting with the methodology:

- [Methodology](tech/methodology.md) :  A brief explanation on the two-stage approach followed for this evaluation.

Then it address separately every logical part/concept of the system:

- [Front-end](tech/parts/client-side.md) : A review on client-side frameworks.
- [Web-server](tech/parts/server-side.md) : A review on server-side frameworks.
- [Communication models](tech/parts/communication.md) : A review on intra-service communication models.
- [Computational services](tech/parts/comp-services.md) : A review on model for a sustainable computational framework.

And concludes with some demonstrations and recommendations:

- [Demonstrations](tech/parts/demos.md) : Frameworks in action
- [Conclusions](tech/conclusion.md) : Wrap up and recommendations
