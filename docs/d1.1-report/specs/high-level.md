- **User Interface**: The user interface shall primarily be a browser-based GUI. It shall be user-friendly and interactive. It shall support interface elements that permit setting parameters and properties, visualizing 3D scenes, displaying data (tables, plots, trees, image-data, etc.) and messages, setting up and displaying work-flows (“workbench”), monitoring and administering computational resources, as well as accessing and managing data (local data and data in the DAT-CORE). With lower priority, the user interface should also offer a scripting interface (Python-based). Through the interface, users shall be able to access data and models (incl. search functionality), manage access rights, set up studies and workflows, execute and monitor services locally and in the cloud, as well as perform analysis and postprocessing. Xxx workbench/flowchart editor xxx
- **Services Infrastructure**: Service environments shall be provided that make it easy to run Python script, to run executables (Linux OS xxx) that take parameters from the command line or standardized input file formats, to compile and execute C, C++, and Java code, to execute R scripts, and xxx. It shall be easy for users to register new services by using one of the predefined service environments and inserting their executables/code/… and it must be simple to specify the required input parameters such that they are exposed through the online GUI. By providing information about the generated output, it shall be possible to present the output using standardized viewers (plots, 3D views, slice field views, isosurface views…). It shall be possible to link services with compatible outputs and inputs into pipelines. Advanced users shall have the possibility of creating services that manage dedicated sections of the online GUI, allowing them superior control also over visualization and interaction. A side-car concept shall be implemented that permits users to enhance services with information about preprocessing, execution, and postprocessing steps to be performed xxx. When executing a service, all the information required to reproduce the execution (input data, parameters, version of service…) shall be stored, to facilitate reproduction.
- **Specialized Services**: A range of commonly required services shall be provided. On the physics solver side, this includes primarily electromagnetic exposure. The most typically required variant of electromagnetic solver is an electroquasistatic solver (for exposure through electrodes) with support for anisotropic electrical conductivity (to handle the important impact of anisotropic neural tissue). Another relevant electromagnetic solver would be magnetoquasistatic solvers (for exposure by coils and loops). Selected teams will also require acoustic propagation, biomechanics, optics, and tissue damage solvers. The platform must support either the import of discretized models (meshes, voxels), or provide discretization services (voxeler, mesher), or both. On the electrophysiological modeling side, the most commonly required solver that shall be supported is NEURON from Yale. Predefined, diameter-parameterized fiber models shall be provided, which must include the MRG model, and shall be assignable along user-defined trajectories. There is large request for an unmyelinated fiber model, but it is currently unclear, which model is suitable. It shall also be possible to load and simulate complex neuron models, defined as .hoc files. It must be possible to coupled electromagnetic exposure conditions with electrophysiological neuron models. Metamodeling services shall be provided that can vary parameters of services or pipelines in order to perform optimization tasks, assess sensitivity, propagate uncertainty, and perform model order reduction. In addition, specialized optimization functionality is required to find optimal stimulation parameters (currents, pulse-shapes) for multi-contact electrodes that produce selective stimulation of fibers. A Python service shall be provided that shall include libraries (such as numpy, scipy, pyplot) to provide users with analysis and postprocessing functionality akin to Matlab. Xxx octave xxx. The creation of a SBML/CellML service is desirable. A coupling service shall allow setups involving more advanced execution schemes and data exchange than simple pipelining, within the limitations imposed by latency and bandwidth. This shall include iterative coupling and bidirectional coupling. A service allowing (ontological) annotation of anatomical and physiological models will be provided by the MAP-CORE.
- **Models**: The platform shall offer anatomical models of human (man&woman) and rodents (xxx). Further anatomical models that shall be considered at a later point include xxx. The anatomical models shall be pre-functionalized with the trajectories of major peripheral nerves. Through a service, it shall be possible to obtain discretized representation of the models or subregions thereof for simulation purposes. It shall be possible to register additional layers of information relative to the anatomical models. This includes measurement and simulation data, image data, nerve trajectories, anatomical detail, device models, as well as electrophysiological models.
- **Computational Infrastructure**: The platform shall initially run on hardware localized at IT’IS. Subsequently, the platform shall run on the Amazon cloud and be flexibly scalable, depending on user demand. It should be considered to add support for execution of selected services (e.g., NEURON simulations) on dedicated high performance computing resources (e.g., NSG portal). 
- **Image-based Modeling**: Functionality shall be available that permits to segment image-data and convert it into anatomical models. It shall be facilitated to generate nerve models from histological images and information, trajectories, and knowledge about fiber type and property distributions. xxx nerve tracing? Xxx. Morphing functionality shall be provided that permits applying transformation fields (e.g., defined based on a grid of control points) to anatomical model and thus parameterize their geometry. xxx registration? Xxx. 
- **Data storage and annotation**: It shall be possible to store models, services, studies, results, and additional data in the DAT-CORE, the cloud, or locally. It shall be possible to enhance data with meta-information, such as links to related information (e.g., links to documentation & validation data), ontological descriptors, or quality certification. It shall be possible to relate data to points or regions within specific anatomical models. Data shall be referenceable (unique identifier, linkable) and traceable (origin of data, versions).
