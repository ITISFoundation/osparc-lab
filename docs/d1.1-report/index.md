## Introduction
This document is related to Deliverable D1.1 of the IT’IS SIM-CORE proposal: “D1.1 –Detailed technical specifications for o2S2PARC, based on user requirements (e.g., from questionnaires) and technology evaluation”. The requirements for the o2S2PARC platform are establish through two activities: 1) contacting SPARC teams to establish their modeling needs and 2) evaluating the relevant software technologies necessary for the effective implementation of the SIM-CORE (mostly based on creating feasibility prototypes). The related Milestones are M1.1, M1.2, and M1.3. These activities have now been completed and the results are summarized in this document. After presenting the requirement gathering approach and effort, the obtained information is summarized and conclusions are drawn (link). The technology evaluation approach and activities are introduced, results are presented, and conclusions are reached (link). From this, high level platform functionality specifications and framework architecture specifications are derived (link).
